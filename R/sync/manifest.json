        "Description": "Boost provides free peer-reviewed portable C++ source \n libraries.  A large part of Boost is provided as C++ template code\n which is resolved entirely at compile-time without linking.  This \n package aims to provide the most useful subset of Boost libraries \n for template use among CRAN packages. By placing these libraries in \n this package, we offer a more efficient distribution system for CRAN \n as replication of this code in the sources of other packages is \n avoided. As of release 1.72.0-3, the following Boost libraries are\n included: 'accumulators' 'algorithm' 'align' 'any' 'atomic' 'bimap'\n 'bind' 'circular_buffer' 'compute' 'concept' 'config' 'container'\n 'date_time' 'detail' 'dynamic_bitset' 'exception' 'flyweight'\n 'foreach' 'functional' 'fusion' 'geometry' 'graph' 'heap' 'icl'\n 'integer' 'interprocess' 'intrusive' 'io' 'iostreams' 'iterator'\n 'math' 'move' 'mp11' 'mpl' 'multiprcecision' 'numeric' 'pending'\n 'phoenix' 'polygon' 'preprocessor' 'propery_tree' 'random' 'range'\n 'scope_exit' 'smart_ptr' 'sort' 'spirit' 'tuple' 'type_traits'\n 'typeof' 'unordered' 'utility' 'uuid'.",

Due to overhead of \n  R calls, actual speed gain depends on the size of the vector: expect gains \n  for vectors of size > 10000 elements. Even for one-time boolean operations \n  it can pay-off to convert to bit, the pay-off is obvious, when such \n  components are used more than once. \n  Reading from and writing to bit is approximately as fast as accessing \n  standard logicals - mostly due to R's time for memory allocation. The package \n  allows to work with pre-allocated memory for return values by calling .Call() \n  directly: when evaluating the speed of C-access with pre-allocated vector \n  memory, coping from bit to logical requires only 70% of the time for copying \n  from logical to logical; and copying from logical to bit comes at a \n  performance penalty of 150%. the package now contains further classes for \n  representing logical selections: 'bitwhich' for very skewed selections and \n  'ri' for selecting ranges of values for chunked processing. All three index \n  classes can be used for subsetting 'ff' objects (ff-2.1-0 and higher).",

In addition to\n    converting JSON data from/to R objects, 'jsonlite' contains functions to\n    stream, validate, and prettify JSON data.
